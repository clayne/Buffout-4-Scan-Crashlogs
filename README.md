# Buffout-4-Scan-Crashlogs
This is my rewrite of Buffout4's Crash Log Scanner Python script.

I will be mostly faithful to the old script, it will generate (mostly) the same output as the old script by default.

This is mainly a code cleanup project, the "old" script does things in a way that doesn't scale to a directory with many crashlogs. Using modern python features and (hopefully) more efficient code, I hope to make this script even better than the old one. I will welcome pull requests when I get the baseline version complete.

This script targets Python 3.10, so make sure you have the latest version of Python installed.

Disclaimer: I am not associated with the Buffout 4 project in any way, shape, or form. This is a personal project that I hope will benefit the Fallout 4 modding community as a whole.
